CATastrophe is a procedurally-generated, side-scrolling platformer in which you play as a cat and liberate the world from its useless possesions. Using a custom-written level design AI, the game distributes platforms and objects at random to create a new player experience every time.

Built by a team of six over two weeks, from initial concept to final product.
